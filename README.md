Please note: the central file is calendar.php - you may have a look on the calendar in action: http://www.meinstylist.com/wp-content/plugins/meinstylist-kernfunktionen/fullcalendar-2.3.1/calendar.php

I am uploading my most recent work which is just a small part of the whole project. It is a booking calendar for http://MeinStylist.com - a German startup company who wants to offer its platform to mobile stylists and their customers for presenting themselves and their services. The customers are able to book services that are being offered by the respective stylist. Even though I am not completely done with the booking calendar (I am finishing the popups that are supposed to appear when custom opening times events are clicked), this little piece will show my ability to combine already existing (http://fullcalendar.io) with new (project-wide database for the self-developed booking system is now connected with the calendar through usage of PHP and JavaScript/JQuery) whereby I can take advantage of my knowledge of all relevant mediums (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript/Plain, JavaScript/JQuery) to get the task done without having to make use of externals. However, I do not only have experience with extending/modifying already existent opensource projects, but also with starting from scratch and involving third party APIs. http://MeinStylist.com is based on Wordpress and the WP-theme "Divi 2". The theme's CSS is partially strongly modified, for example on the main page. The search-for-stylists page (http://MeinStylist.com/suche) is designed from scratch, setting all wordpress-given DOM structures on display=none and inserting the replacing code through a self-developed Wordpress plugin (meinstylist-kernfunktionen). This plugin is used as well for all the other functional parts of the website, having shortcodes in the WP-articles being replaced with actual HTML. The whole website is responsive.

Since uploading the sources of the whole project would mean that I would have to go through all of the immense amount of code to make sure that I am not giving third parties access to business-related sensative code, I am just uploading a little piece. Please let me know if there is any need to have a look on further work of mine.
